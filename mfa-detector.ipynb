These are sites that generate money by driving user visits through clicks on adverts placed cheaply on social media sites or at the bottom of genuine news articles, these visits are then turned into advertising revenue on their site. The content on MFA sites is generally complete rubbish: fake celeberity gossip, phony deals on expensive clothes, seemingly lucrative financial advice... All designed to drive traffic to their site, no matter how fleeting. \n\n  MFA owners have cleverly made their sites very attractrive places to advertise on, at least on the surface; high viewability , impressive click rates and low CPMs mean that when automatic processes are deployed to optimise digital marketing campaigns, large sums of money are directed towards them, so much so that MFA is now a multi-billion dollar industry. \n\n  The complete lack of journalistic integrity and the fact that it is now considered an embarsement to have your brand name appear on one of these sites means that advertisers have recently decided that any and all brand activity on these sites should cease. Digital marketers have reacted quickly by blocking large lists of sites with low proportions of organic visits (people visiting the site by simply searching it) compared to those driven there by clicks. For the time being this has kept the MFA sites at bay, however inevitably there will be ways found around this, especially with a multi-billion dolar industy at stake. \n\n  Whether it's the equivuilant of click farms in Asia , or bots on ever moving VPN adresses automating the process, ways will be found to forge organic visits, rendering the ratio mentioned above useless. However what wont change about these sites is the content. The way they keep their costs down is by generating countless, cheap, clickbait articles and then bombarding you with ads before you get the chance to leave the page. A human can take one look at these sites and tell what it is. But can a machine?
